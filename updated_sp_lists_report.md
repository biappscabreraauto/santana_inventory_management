# **SharePoint Lists Configuration Report**

Project: Santana Inventory Management Tool  
Date: July 15, 2025  
Status: All lists designed and ready for population with hybrid solution implementation.

### **Overview**

This report provides a detailed specification for each of the five SharePoint lists that form the data foundation for the inventory management application. All lists are prefixed with simt_ to ensure clear organization within the designated SharePoint site: https://cabreraautopr.sharepoint.com/sites/DataCollectionSystem.

**Important Note:** Due to a confirmed Microsoft Graph API bug with custom lookup fields, the Category field in simt_Parts has been converted to a text field using a hybrid solution approach. This maintains full functionality while working around the API limitation.

### **1. simt_Categories**

**Purpose:** This list acts as a centralized master table for all product families and their corresponding categories. It ensures data integrity and enables cascading dropdowns in the user interface.

| Display Name | System Name | Type | Configuration / Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Category** | Title | Single line of text | **Primary Key**. The unique name for the category (e.g., "Air Filter"). |
| **Family** | Family | Choice | The parent family. Choices include: Belt Drive, Body & Lamp Assembly, Brake & Wheel Hub, Cooling System, Drivetrain, Electrical, Engine, etc. |

**Data Sample:**
- Category: "Air Filter", Family: "Fuel & Air"
- Category: "Brake Hose", Family: "Brake & Wheel Hub"
- Category: "Oil Filter", Family: "Engine"

### **2. simt_Parts (Modified for Hybrid Solution)**

**Purpose:** This is the master catalog for every unique part in the inventory. It holds descriptive information and tracks the real-time quantity on hand.

| Display Name | Type | Configuration / Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Part ID** | Single line of text | **Primary Key**. The unique part number or SKU. Renamed from the default "Title" column. |
| **Description** | Multiple lines of text | A detailed description of the part. |
| **Category** | **Single line of text** | **HYBRID SOLUTION**: Changed from Lookup to text field due to Graph API bug. Application validates against simt_Categories list. |
| **InventoryOnHand** | Number | Stores the current real-time stock level for the part. |
| **UnitCost** | Currency | The cost paid for the part. |
| **UnitPrice** | Currency | The default selling price for the part. |
| **Status** | Choice | The current status of the part. Choices: Active, Obsolete, Disposed. |

**Important Changes:**
- **Category field converted from Lookup to Single line of text**
- **Family information calculated dynamically from simt_Categories**
- **Application-level validation ensures data integrity**
- **Enhanced UI provides dropdown functionality and family auto-display**

### **3. simt_Buyers**

**Purpose:** A simple Customer Relationship Management (CRM) list to store information about the people or companies who purchase parts.

| Display Name | System Name | Type | Configuration / Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Buyer Name** | Title | Single line of text | **Primary Key**. The full name of the person or company. |
| **Contact Email** | ContactEmail | Single line of text | The buyer's email address. |
| **Phone** | Phone | Single line of text | The buyer's phone number. |

### **4. simt_Invoices**

**Purpose:** This list is the core of the sales process. Each item represents a single sales transaction and groups all the parts sold to a specific buyer at a specific time.

| Display Name | System Name | Type | Configuration / Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Invoice #** | Title | Single line of text | **Primary Key**. The unique identifier for the invoice. |
| **Buyer** | Buyer | Lookup | Looks up to the simt_Buyers list. <br> ‚Ä¢ **Source List:** simt_Buyers <br> ‚Ä¢ **Source Column:** Buyer Name |
| **InvoiceDate** | InvoiceDate | Date and Time | The date the invoice was created. |
| **TotalAmount** | TotalAmount | Currency | The calculated total value of the invoice. |
| **Status** | Status | Choice | The current status of the invoice. Choices: Draft, Finalized, Paid, Void. |

### **5. simt_Transactions**

**Purpose:** This is the detailed, immutable ledger of all inventory movements. Every time a part enters or leaves the inventory, a record is created here. "Out" movements are always linked to an invoice.

| Display Name | Type | Configuration / Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Title** | **Not in use** | **Ignore: application will not read from it or write to it** |
| **Part** | Lookup | Looks up to the simt_Parts list. <br> ‚Ä¢ **Source List:** simt_Parts <br> ‚Ä¢ **Source Column:** Part ID |
| **MovementType** | Choice | The direction of the movement. Choices: In (Received), Out (Sold). |
| **Quantity** | Number | The number of units moved. Always a positive number. |
| **Invoice** | Lookup | **Required for "Out" movements.** Looks up to the simt_Invoices list. <br> ‚Ä¢ **Source List:** simt_Invoices <br> ‚Ä¢ **Source Column:** Invoice # |
| **Buyer** | Lookup | **Required for "Out" movements.** Looks up to the simt_Buyers list. <br> ‚Ä¢ **Source List:** simt_Buyers <br> ‚Ä¢ **Source Column:** Buyer Name (Title) |
| **UnitCost** | Currency | The cost per unit for "In" movements. |
| **UnitPrice** | Currency | The price per unit for "Out" movements. |
| **Notes** | Multiple lines of text | Optional notes about the transaction (e.g., condition, reason for adjustment). |

## **Hybrid Solution Implementation**

### **Problem Statement**
Microsoft Graph API has a confirmed bug where custom lookup fields are not returned in API responses, despite being properly configured in SharePoint. This affected the Category field in simt_Parts, preventing proper functionality.

### **Solution Approach**
**Hybrid Text Field + Categories List Validation:**
- Convert Category field from Lookup to Single line of text
- Maintain simt_Categories list for data management
- Implement application-level validation and dropdown functionality
- Calculate Family information dynamically from Categories list

### **Benefits of Hybrid Solution**
- ‚úÖ **Immediate functionality** - bypasses Graph API bug
- ‚úÖ **Full dropdown support** - enhanced UI with category/family selection
- ‚úÖ **Data integrity** - application validates against Categories list
- ‚úÖ **Performance** - categories cached for fast lookups
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility** - can add search, filtering, and cascading dropdowns
- ‚úÖ **Future-proof** - can migrate to proper lookup when API is fixed

### **Trade-offs**
- ‚ùå **SharePoint UI** - manual text entry (users won't use this)
- ‚ùå **Referential integrity** - no database-level constraints
- ‚ùå **Native SharePoint features** - grouping, Power Platform integration
